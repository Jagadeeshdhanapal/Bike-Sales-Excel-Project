Data:
The dataset used in this project consists of various details such as marital status, gender, income, education, occupation, home ownership, commute distance, region, and age of the buyers.

Tools and Technologies:
Microsoft Excel
Pivot Tables
Excel Dashboard
Data Details
The dataset includes the following columns:

Marital Status: Indicates whether the buyer is married.
Gender: Gender of the buyer.
Income ($): Annual income of the buyer in dollars.
Children: Number of children the buyer has.

Methodology
Step 1: Data Cleaning
Ensure the data is clean and consistent. This involves removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.

Step 2: Creating Pivot Tables
Create pivot tables to summarize and analyze the data based on various criteria such as:
Total sales by region
Sales distribution by gender and marital status
Average income of buyers
Bike purchase rates by education level and occupation

Step 3: Building the Dashboard
Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the key metrics and trends. The dashboard will include elements such as:

Bar charts illustrating bike sales by region
Pie charts representing the distribution of bike buyers by gender and marital status
Line graphs showing trends in bike purchases over time
Metrics displaying the average income and commute distance of bike buyers

Key Insights
Sales Distribution by Region: Identify which regions have the highest and lowest bike sales.

Demographic Patterns: Analyze how factors such as income, education, and occupation influence bike purchase decisions.
Gender and Marital Status Impact: Understand the differences in purchasing behavior between males and females, and between married and single individuals.
Income Influence: Determine the impact of income levels on the likelihood of purchasing a bike.
